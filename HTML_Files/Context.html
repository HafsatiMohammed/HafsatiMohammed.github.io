                <p class="Para2" > My Ph.D. thesis focuses on the problem of navigating with 6DoF in the 3D sound fields that are acquired from a live recording. Nowadays,
           there is a focus around virtual reality content that allows the user to move freely with 6DoF. Most of the proposed contents these past decades were purely synthetic images and sound.  By synthetic,
           I mean they do not project a real environment. If ever I want to navigate virtually in a real environment, I must first record it, and therefore, use cameras and microphones. 
my Ph.D. work treats the audio aspect of this application. I chose to work with ambisonics as a 3D technology due to its several advantages for this application. </p>
