    <p class= "PP1"> Solution: </p>
                <p class="Para2"> To respond to the problem, I developed a navigation strategy that is based on sound source localization and sound source separation. For my strategy, I proposed two variants: </p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        For the first variant, I applied a simple plane wave decomposition using full-band beamforming techniques, and a reconstruction of the sound field according to the current user position.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        For the second variant, I proposed to decompose the ambisonic sound field using a multichannel sound source separation, followed by a plane wave decomposition, and a reconstruction of the ambisonic sound field
                        according to the current user position.
                    </li>
                    
                </ol>
                  
                <p class="Para2">
For the sound source localization, we surveyed several approaches in the ambisonic domain and the microphone domain. We adapted the microphone domain methods to the ambisonic domain and assessed them through
some numerical experiments. The results were satisfying in terms of localizing the sound sources. The used methods were (MENUET, DEMIX, HARPEX, MVDR, MUSIC). 
In terms of navigation, my strategy was tested using an objective metric. The numerical experiment showed that the second variant of our strategy was efficient compared to one of the best approaches in state of the art.
The second variant of our strategy is based on multichannel sound source separation of ambisonic sound fields. However, such techniques are lacking in terms of research.
