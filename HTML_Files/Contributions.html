                <p class="Para2"> In terms of multichannel sound source separation in the ambisonic domain, I contributed with the following works (check the scroling menu to listen to some examples of sound source separation):
</p>
<ol>
    <li>In the microphone domain,
there is a multichannel sound separation approach that was proposed ten years ago and had never been used in the ambisonic domain yet. 
The approach is known as the multichannel sound source separation based on the local Gaussian model. I derived the equations of the model from the microphone domain to the ambisonic domain.
It turned out that such a technique can be used in the ambisonic domain. I validated the approach with some numerical experiments. Refereed to as FASST </li>
    <li> I proposed to use the local Gaussian model approach along with some side information that is coming from live recording spot microphones. I proposed a method to help the pre-processing
 of the side information and validate the efficiency of each block of the workflow through some numerical experiments. Refereed to as SpotMic  </li>
    <li> I proposed to use neural networks in the place of the spot microphones for musical content. I developed two different neural networks and compared the performances of the
multichannel sound source separation through numerical experiments. Refereed to as NN_EachForOne and NN_OneForAll  </li>
